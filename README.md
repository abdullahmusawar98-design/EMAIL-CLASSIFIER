# 📧 Spam Email Classifier
# 1. Introduction

Email spam detection is an important application of machine learning and natural language processing. Spam emails can contain advertisements, misleading content, or malicious links. Manual filtering is inefficient, therefore automated classification systems are required to identify spam emails accurately.

This project focuses on classifying emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using both traditional machine learning models and deep learning techniques.

# 2. Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

To build an automated email spam classification system

To compare traditional machine learning models with deep learning models

To evaluate model performance using Confusion Matrix and ROC–AUC score

# 3. Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains labeled email messages.
